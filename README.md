# Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic Tic Tac Toe (X & O) game built with React.  
The project was created as a learning exercise to practice React concepts and game logic implementation.

## Project Overview
This game allows two players to play against each other on the same board.  
Players can change their names, take turns selecting squares, and the game automatically detects win, loss, or draw scenarios.

The project focuses on combining UI interactivity with clean and predictable game logic.
